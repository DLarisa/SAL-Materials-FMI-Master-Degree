Lecture 1 (October, 5th)
We have discussed general aspects (e.g., grading, course organization). We did a Kahoot
(see Basics.xlsx in Lecture Materials). Revise the notions/concepts in the Kahoot questions.   



Lecture 2 (October, 12th)
We have introduced the course project (see Course Projects section). We have discussed general principles, 
in relation to network security (see Lecture materials > Pages on Security: 6. Principles). We have discussed 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), you have seen the presentation of WEP by D.Boneh available online at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8c0lFqvH2w&list=PL2jykFOD1AWYosqucluZghEVjUkopdD1e&t=418s 
(start: 6:50 - end: 13:37), then we discussed WEP in detail (see Lecture Materials > 12_pages_on_security.pdf)



Lecture 3 (October, 19th)
We argued about the security of WEP (see Lecture Materials > WEP EN.pdf). We have watched a short video on 802.1x:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3XJH0xvS1o. We have talked about WiFi Protected Access (WPA) and its improvements
over WEP but also its limitations - (see Lecture Materials > 13_pages_on_security.pdf).



Lecture 4 (October, 26th)
We have started with a Kahoot to test your knowledge from the previous lecture 
(see the results in Lecture Materials > Standards, Technologies, Protocols.xlsx). We have continued with WPA 
and discussed the 4-way handshake (see Lecture Materials > 20_pages_on_security). We talked about WPA2 and related 
notions (RSN, CCMP, key hierarchy, etc.) (see Lecture Materials > 17_pages_on_security). You can read more online 
about WPA2 vulnerabilities and attacks (e.g., KRACK - https://www.krackattacks.com/ , Kr00k).



Lecture 5 (November, 2nd):
You solved two exercises (Activities > WPA2 vs WPA/WEP and 802.1X/RSN/WPA2/802.11i). We have then talked about 
the WPA3 (see Lecture Materials > 21_pages_on_security). I suggest you to have a look at these resources:

https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/security 
We have discussed some of the statements from the last years’ exams - the first exercise. We will continue with 
the second exam next time.  For next time, have a look at exercise 3 from Exam 2019-2020 and exercise 2 from 
Exam 2020-2021. We will discuss them during the next lecture.



Lecture 6 (November, 9th)
We have discussed the remaining exercises from the last years’ exams (see Lecture 5 info). We have started to study 
mobile security with a short intro on mobile networks and focus on 5G, as not many of you chose their course topic. 
You have been pointed out to search for information in the standards (3GPP, ETSI, etc.) or other organizations 
(e.g., ENISA, NIST) whenever needed. 



Lecture 7 (November, 16th)
We have started to study mobile security and GSM (2G) security (see Lecture Materials > 23_pages_on_security and 
the slides from the last years). You can find the MCC and MNC values for different countries and operators here: 
https://www.mcc-mnc.com.



Lecture 8 (November, 23rd)
We have attended one presentation on 5G security (see Course Projects section). We have discussed exercise 2 from 
2019-2020 exam. We have started our discussion on LTE security (see the lecture slides from last years).



Lecture 9 (December, 7th)
We have continued our study on LTE security. 



Lecture 10 (December, 14th)
We discussed exercise 3 from Exam 2021-2022.



Lecture 11 (December, 21st)
We have attended 7 presentations on 5G security.



Lecture 12 (January, 3rd)
You need to read about VPN, IPSec and SSL/TLS by yourself:
https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-vpn 
From https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230674947_Springer_Encyclopedia_of_Cryptography_and_Security - IPSec (starting at pp.310), 
SSL (starting at pp.548), and TLS (starting pp.624).



Lecture 13 (January, 11th)
Continue self learning on SSL/TLS: watch https://youtu.be/AZKTwTn8szE?list=PL2jykFOD1AWb07OLBdFI2QIHvPo3aTTeu
and remember what you read in Springer Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security last time. 
The RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446 . 
Remember that SSL/TLS is part of the curriculum, as well as the presentations on 5G.
